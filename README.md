Hi there! Welcome to Budgetopia, a budget managing app for Students. Earn Rewards by maintain your Budget.  

This project is for the 2nd Challege given by BidFX.   


##Project explanation:  

This webpage consists of a Homepage and a Budget and Rewards Page. The Budget and Rewards page allows the user to set their monthly budget, as well as adding their daily transaction. The program helps the user to calculate their remaining budget of the month. At the end of the month, if the user has not exceeded their monthly budget, they will earn 10 points and if they do exceed the budget limit, 5 points will be deducted. If they reach 50 points, they will get an amazon voucher worth of $15. Similarly, for 100 points, they will receive a google store voucher worth of $20. And if they reach 1000 points, they will receive a spotify membership for a year. These rewards act as an intensive for the users to meet their ideal budget.
